                I am a technology enthusiast who from a young age showed interest in the operation of computers and
                software. I studied a technical career in computer systems, where I acquired knowledge in programming,
                databases and web development. Currently I am studying computer engineering at the University of
                Guadalajara.

            <p class="presentation__content__paragraph">
                I consider myself a responsible person, committed and eager to learn and grow in the field of
                programming and technology. I like to work in a team and I am always willing to help others. I am
                passionate about the idea of being able to create technological solutions that improve people's lives
                and contribute to the development of society. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities
                to keep learning and growing as a professional.
